## 🎯 Design Principles

### 1. Security First
- **Memory Safety**: Built with Rust to prevent buffer overflows and memory corruption
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal permissions for all components
- **Isolation**: Strong process and memory isolation
- **Secure Boot**: Hardware-backed boot chain verification

### 2. Multi-Architecture Support
- **Unified Codebase**: Single codebase supporting multiple architectures
- **Architecture Abstraction**: Clean separation between generic and platform-specific code
- **Cross-Compilation**: Seamless building for different target platforms

### 3. Modularity
- **Microkernel Influence**: Modular design with clear interfaces
- **Plugin Architecture**: Loadable drivers and modules
- **Service Orientation**: System services as separate processes

### 4. Performance
- **Zero-Copy I/O**: Efficient data handling without unnecessary copying
- **NUMA Awareness**: Optimized for modern multi-core systems
- **Real-Time Support**: Low-latency scheduling capabilities
