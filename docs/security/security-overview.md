# SAGE OS Security Overview

## Introduction

SAGE OS implements a comprehensive security model designed to protect against modern threats while maintaining performance and usability. This document provides an overview of the security architecture and implemented protections.

## Security Architecture

### Defense in Depth

SAGE OS employs multiple layers of security:

1. **Hardware Security**: Leveraging hardware security features
2. **Boot Security**: Secure boot process and integrity verification
3. **Kernel Security**: Memory protection and privilege separation
4. **Application Security**: Sandboxing and resource isolation
5. **Network Security**: Secure communication protocols

### Security Principles

- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Components run with minimal required permissions
- **Fail-Safe Defaults**: Secure defaults for all configurations
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers
- **Security by Design**: Security considerations from the ground up

## Incident Response

### Response Process

1. **Detection**: Automated and manual threat detection
2. **Analysis**: Threat assessment and classification
3. **Containment**: Immediate threat isolation
4. **Eradication**: Threat removal and system cleaning
5. **Recovery**: System restoration and validation
6. **Lessons Learned**: Post-incident analysis and improvement

### Communication Plan
