#### Fix Implemented
```c
// Added safe alternative
char* strcpy_safe(char* dest, const char* src, size_t dest_size) {
    if (dest == NULL || src == NULL || dest_size == 0) {
        return NULL;
    }
    
    size_t i;
    for (i = 0; i < dest_size - 1 && src[i] != '\0'; i++) {
        dest[i] = src[i];
    }
    dest[i] = '\0';  // Ensure null termination
    return dest;
}
```

#### Verification
- âœ… Safe alternative provided
- âœ… Input validation implemented
- âœ… Bounds checking enforced
