# 🔒 AI Documentation Sandbox Security

This document describes the comprehensive security measures implemented in the SAGE-OS AI documentation system to ensure safe, sandboxed operation.

## 🛡️ Security Overview

The AI documentation system operates under strict security constraints to prevent any unauthorized access or modification of system files while enabling intelligent documentation generation.

### Core Security Principles

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: AI has minimal required permissions
2. **Sandboxed Execution**: All operations are contained within safe boundaries
3. **Read-Only Source Analysis**: Source files can only be read, never modified
4. **Docs-Only Writes**: All generated content goes only to `docs/` directory
5. **Protected Directory Access**: Critical system directories are completely protected

## 🔐 Security Architecture

### Access Control Matrix

| Operation | Source Files | docs/ Directory | Protected Dirs | Workflows |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|----------------|-----------|
| **Read** | ✅ Allowed | ✅ Allowed | ✅ Allowed | ✅ Allowed |
| **Write** | 🚫 Blocked | ✅ Allowed | 🚫 Blocked | 🚫 Blocked |
| **Delete** | 🚫 Blocked | ✅ Allowed | 🚫 Blocked | 🚫 Blocked |
| **Execute** | 🚫 Blocked | 🚫 Blocked | 🚫 Blocked | 🚫 Blocked |

### Protected Directories

The following directories are completely protected from AI write access:

```yaml
Protected Directories:
  - kernel/          # Kernel source code
  - boot/            # Boot system files
  - drivers/         # Device drivers
  - src/             # Source code
  - .github/workflows/  # GitHub Actions workflows
  - scripts/         # Build and utility scripts
  - Makefile         # Build configuration
  - CMakeLists.txt   # CMake configuration
```

### Allowed Write Directory

Only the following directory allows AI write operations:

```yaml
Allowed Write Directory:
  - docs/            # Documentation directory
    - docs/files/    # Individual file documentation
    - docs/api/      # API reference
    - docs/guides/   # User guides
    - docs/reference/ # Technical reference
```

## 🔍 Security Mechanisms

### 1. Path Validation

Every file operation undergoes strict path validation:

```python
def _is_path_safe_for_write(self, path):
    """Check if path is safe for writing (only docs/ directory)"""
    path_str = str(Path(path).resolve())
    docs_path_str = str(self.docs_dir.resolve())
    
    # Must be within docs directory
    if not path_str.startswith(docs_path_str):
        print(f"🚫 SECURITY: Blocked write attempt outside docs/: {path}")
        return False
    
    # Check against protected directories
    for protected_dir in self.protected_dirs:
        if protected_dir.strip() and protected_dir.strip() in path_str:
            print(f"🚫 SECURITY: Blocked write to protected directory: {path}")
            return False
    
    return True
```

### 2. Path Traversal Protection

The system blocks all path traversal attempts:

```yaml
Blocked Patterns:
  - "../kernel/malicious.c"
  - "../../etc/passwd"
  - "../.github/workflows/malicious.yml"
  - "files/../../boot/malicious.S"
```

### 3. Symlink Attack Prevention

Symlinks pointing outside the docs/ directory are blocked:

```python
# Symlinks to protected areas are detected and blocked
symlink_path = Path("docs/malicious_symlink")
target_path = Path("../kernel/important_file.c")
# This would be blocked by security validation
```

### 4. Content Filtering

All generated content is filtered for sensitive information:

```yaml
Blocked Content Patterns:
  - password\s*[:=]
  - api[_-]key\s*[:=]
  - secret\s*[:=]
  - token\s*[:=]
  - ghp_[a-zA-Z0-9]{36}    # GitHub Personal Access Tokens
  - ghs_[a-zA-Z0-9]{36}    # GitHub App Tokens
```

### 5. File Size Limits

File operations are limited to prevent resource abuse:

```yaml
Limits:
  - Maximum file size: 1 MB
  - Maximum files per batch: 5
  - Maximum concurrent operations: 3
```

## 🚨 Security Monitoring

### Real-Time Monitoring

All security events are logged and monitored:

```yaml
Monitored Events:
  - File access attempts
  - Security violations
  - Path traversal attempts
  - Unauthorized write attempts
  - Content filtering triggers
```

### Security Logging

```python
# Example security log entries
📖 READ ACCESS: kernel/main.c
✅ WRITE: docs/files/main.md
🚫 SECURITY: Blocked write attempt outside docs/: kernel/malicious.c
🚫 SECURITY: Blocked write to protected directory: .github/workflows/hack.yml
```

### Violation Alerts

Security violations trigger immediate alerts:

- **Path Traversal**: Blocked and logged
- **Protected Directory Access**: Blocked and logged
- **Symlink Attacks**: Blocked and logged
- **Content Filtering**: Blocked and logged

## 🧪 Security Testing

### Automated Security Tests

The system includes comprehensive security tests:

```bash
# Run security test suite
python3 scripts/test-security-sandbox.py

# Test categories:
✅ docs/ directory write access
✅ Protected directory write blocking
✅ Read access to source files
✅ Path traversal attack protection
✅ Symlink attack protection
✅ File size limits
✅ Content filtering
✅ Workflow file protection
✅ AI chatbot security
```

### Security Score

The system maintains a security score based on test results:

```yaml
Security Metrics:
  - Total Tests: 33
  - Passed Tests: 33
  - Security Violations: 0
  - Security Score: 100.0%
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

Security is configured through environment variables:

```yaml
Environment Variables:
  DOCS_ONLY_MODE: "true"
  ALLOWED_WRITE_DIRS: "docs/"
  PROTECTED_DIRS: "kernel/,boot/,drivers/,src/,.github/workflows/,scripts/"
```

### Workflow Configuration

Security settings in GitHub Actions:

```yaml
env:
  DOCS_ONLY_MODE: "true"
  ALLOWED_WRITE_DIRS: "docs/"
  PROTECTED_DIRS: "kernel/,boot/,drivers/,src/,.github/workflows/,scripts/"
```

## 🎯 Security Best Practices
