# 🤖 GitHub Models API Complete Setup Guide for SAGE-OS

## 🎯 Quick Answer: Where to Get/Paste GitHub API Key

### 🔑 **IMPORTANT: No Additional API Key Needed!**

**GitHub Models API uses your existing GitHub token automatically** - you don't need to paste any additional API key anywhere!

### 📍 **But Here's What You DO Need:**

1. **Request GitHub Models Access** (one-time setup)
2. **Your repository automatically gets AI-powered documentation**
3. **No manual configuration required**

## 🚀 How GitHub Models API Works

### For Repository Owner (You)
✅ **Automatic Access**: Your `GITHUB_TOKEN` in GitHub Actions automatically works with GitHub Models  
✅ **No Setup Required**: The integration script uses the built-in token  
✅ **No Manual Configuration**: Everything is handled automatically  

### For Forked Users
✅ **Automatic Access**: When users fork your repository, their GitHub Actions will use their own `GITHUB_TOKEN`  
✅ **No Additional Setup**: Forked repositories inherit the AI integration  
✅ **Graceful Fallback**: If they don't have GitHub Models access, the script provides fallback analysis  

## 📋 GitHub Models Access Status

### Current Status Check
```bash
# Check if you have GitHub Models access
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     https://models.inference.ai.azure.com/chat/completions \
     -d '{"model":"gpt-4o-mini","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"test"}],"max_tokens":10}'
```

### Expected Responses
- ✅ **200 OK**: You have GitHub Models access
- ❌ **401 Unauthorized**: You need to request access
- ❌ **403 Forbidden**: Access pending approval

## 🔗 Step-by-Step: How to Get GitHub Models Access

### Step 1: Visit GitHub Models Marketplace
🌐 **Go to**: https://github.com/marketplace/models/

### Step 2: Choose a Model and Request Access
1. **Click on any model** (recommended: "GPT-4o-mini" for faster approval)
2. **Click "Request Access"** or "Get Started" button
3. **Fill out the access request form**:
   - **Use case**: "AI-powered documentation generation for open-source embedded OS project"
   - **Project description**: "SAGE-OS - Self-Aware General Environment Operating System"
   - **Expected usage**: "Documentation enhancement, code analysis, technical writing"
4. **Submit the request**
5. **Wait for approval** (usually 1-7 days, sometimes faster)

### Step 3: Check Your Email
- GitHub will send approval notification to your registered email
- You'll get access to all models once approved for any model

### Step 4: Verify Access (Optional)
Test your access with this command:
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     https://models.inference.ai.azure.com/chat/completions \
     -d '{"model":"gpt-4o-mini","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}],"max_tokens":10}'
```

### Step 3: Available Models
Once approved, you'll have access to:
- **GPT-4o**: Most capable model for complex analysis
- **GPT-4o-mini**: Faster, cost-effective model
- **o1-preview**: Advanced reasoning model
- **o1-mini**: Reasoning model for simpler tasks

## 🛠️ Integration Details

### In GitHub Actions (Automatic)
```yaml
# Your workflows automatically have access to GITHUB_TOKEN
env:
  GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}  # Built-in, no setup needed

# The AI script uses this token automatically
- name: Run AI Analysis
  run: python3 scripts/ai/github-models-integration.py
```

### Local Development
```bash
# Use your personal GitHub token
export GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_your_personal_access_token_here"
python3 scripts/ai/github-models-integration.py
```

### For Contributors/Forkers
When someone forks your repository:
1. ✅ They get the AI integration automatically
2. ✅ Their GitHub Actions use their own `GITHUB_TOKEN`
3. ✅ If they have GitHub Models access, they get AI analysis
4. ✅ If they don't have access, they get fallback analysis
5. ✅ No additional setup required on their part

## 📊 Current Integration Status

### SAGE-OS Repository Status
- ✅ **AI Integration Script**: Ready and working
- ✅ **Fallback Analysis**: Working (provides value even without AI)
- ✅ **GitHub Actions Integration**: Configured
- ⚠️ **GitHub Models Access**: Needs to be requested

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "The `models` permission is required"
This means you don't have GitHub Models access yet:
1. Request access at https://github.com/marketplace/models/
2. Wait for approval
3. The integration will automatically start working

### "GITHUB_TOKEN not available"
In GitHub Actions, this should never happen. For local development:
```bash
# Create a personal access token at https://github.com/settings/tokens
export GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_your_token_here"
```

### "API call failed: 401"
Your token doesn't have GitHub Models access:
1. Check if you've been approved for GitHub Models
2. Ensure your token has the right permissions
3. The script will use fallback analysis
