# SAGE OS 🌱🧠
**Self-Aware General Environment**  
An experimental, bare-metal operating system designed from scratch to learn, adapt, and evolve — starting on Raspberry Pi.

---
 
  ## 🔭 Vision 

**SAGE OS** is not just another operating system. It is a living, evolving system designed to:

- Think autonomously
- Learn from usage patterns
- Optimize itself through artificial intelligence
- Rebuild and evolve its components as needed

This is an experiment at the intersection of **kernel engineering**, **embedded systems**, and **machine intelligence** — pushing the boundaries of what an operating system can become.

  <summary>🎯 Objectives</summary>

- Build a fully bootable, bare-metal operating system from scratch
- Integrate basic AI/ML models to inform system-level decisions
- Enable self-monitoring and self-optimization over time
- Keep the codebase portable across architectures (starting with ARM/RPi)

  <summary>⚙️ Functional Goals</summary>

- [x] Custom bootloader for Raspberry Pi
- [x] Basic kernel with memory & process management
- [ ] Custom command-line shell (SAGE Shell)
- [ ] Integrated AI agent (TinyML / rule-based to start)
- [ ] Self-tuning task scheduler and memory allocator
- [ ] Support for minimal file system
- [ ] Ability to evolve through version-aware updates

  <summary>🧠 AI & Machine Learning Integration</summary>

SAGE OS will include embedded, resource-efficient AI components that can:
- Perform local inference (TinyML)
- Observe usage and optimize scheduling
- Trigger self-diagnostics and reconfiguration
- Eventually, enable modular regeneration of subsystems
