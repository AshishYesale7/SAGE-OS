## Test Execution Examples

### File Operations Test
```
sage> save test.txt Hello from SAGE OS
File 'test.txt' saved successfully
sage> cat test.txt
Hello from SAGE OS
sage> append test.txt Additional content
Content appended to 'test.txt' successfully
sage> cat test.txt
Hello from SAGE OSAdditional content
sage> fileinfo test.txt
File: test.txt
Size: 36 bytes
Lines: 1
Words: 5
Preview:
Hello from SAGE OSAdditional content
```

### Text Editor Test
```
sage> nano test2.txt
Creating new file: test2.txt
Enter new content (end with a line containing only '.')
> This is line 1
> This is line 2
> .
File 'test2.txt' saved successfully
sage> cat test2.txt
This is line 1
This is line 2
```

### File System Listing
```
sage> ls
Files in /:
+--------------------+----------+---------+---------+
| Name               | Size     | Created | Modified|
