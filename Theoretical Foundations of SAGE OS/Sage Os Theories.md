# Theoretical Foundations of SAGE OS

This directory contains individual markdown files for each theoretical vision or concept behind the development of **SAGE OS** — a self-evolving, AI-integrated operating system designed for deep architectural innovation.

## 📁 Index of Theory Files

* [`01_self_evolving_os.md`](./01_self_evolving_os.md) — The concept of an OS that modifies, patches, and evolves itself without external updates.
* [`02_ai_system_agent.md`](./02_ai_system_agent.md) — Embedding AI as a core part of the OS, responsible for hardware, scheduling, and self-management.
* [`03_ai_hardware_communication.md`](./03_ai_hardware_communication.md) — Exploring non-standard, emergent communication methods between AI and hardware devices ("gibberlink mode").
* [`04_software_energy_control.md`](./04_software_energy_control.md) — Manipulating energy states at the transistor/register level via software intelligence.
* [`05_energy_to_mass_conversion.md`](./05_energy_to_mass_conversion.md) — Speculative theory of AI involvement in physical transformations such as energy-to-matter conversion.
* [`06_architectural_evolution.md`](./06_architectural_evolution.md) — Allowing AI to redesign not just code, but entire system architecture including instruction sets and device interaction models.
* [`07_system_self_awareness.md`](./07_system_self_awareness.md) — Theoretical pursuit of system-level awareness and autonomous intent.
* [`08_Model_Context_Protocol(MCP).md`](./08_Model_Context_Protocol(MCP).md) - to enable AI assistants to interface with external services, tools, and hardware .
*[`09_AI-Driven OS for Evolving Hardware Adaptation and Self-Updating Capabilities.md`](./09_AI-Driven_OS_for_Evolving_Hardware Adaptation_and_Self-Updating_Capabilities.md) - implementing the idea of an AI-driven OS that can automatically detect hardware architecture, write, compile, and update drivers, and evolve itself by interacting with external sources.
