# Code of Conduct for SAGE OS

## 🌐 Introduction

The SAGE OS project is an ambitious and collaborative initiative to build an intelligent, self-evolving operating system from scratch. As such, it welcomes contributions from individuals with diverse backgrounds, skills, and experiences. To maintain a respectful, safe, and productive environment, all participants are expected to adhere to this Code of Conduct.

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces—GitHub discussions, pull requests, issues, documentation, and other forms of communication related to SAGE OS—both online and offline.

## 🤝 Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to:

* Be respectful, inclusive, and kind in all interactions.
* Listen actively and engage constructively.
* Value diverse perspectives and experiences.
* Provide constructive feedback and assistance.
* Show empathy toward others.

## 🚫 Unacceptable Behavior

## ✅ Expected Behavior

Participants are expected to:

* Use inclusive and welcoming language.
* Respect differing viewpoints and experiences.
* Accept constructive criticism gracefully.

Maintainers reserve the right to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct.

Confidentiality and discretion will be maintained in all such cases.
