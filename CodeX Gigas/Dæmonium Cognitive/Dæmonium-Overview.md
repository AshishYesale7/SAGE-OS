# 🧠 Dæmonium Cognitive Agent Pipeline

**Dæmonium Cognitive** is a personalized, self-evolving AI agent built into SAGE OS. It passively observes the user's digital behavior, learns from real-world problem-solving patterns, and evolves to act autonomously in future contexts—mimicking the user's thinking process.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Learn from real-time digital activity (web, apps, files, system usage).
- Adapt to user's personal decision-making strategies over time.
- Perform passive behavioral modeling with local training.
- Use self-supervised or reinforcement learning to evolve.
- Become a cognitive extension of the user inside SAGE OS.

## 🔁 Cognitive Agent Pipeline (Overview)

The pipeline is designed to continuously monitor, learn, and refine the model in the background.

### 🧩 Major Components

| Component               | Description |
|-------------------------|-------------|
| `Activity Logger`       | Monitors app usage, shell commands, file access, web queries. |
| `Event Processor`       | Normalizes and time-stamps all events. |
| `Memory Store`          | Stores short-term and long-term digital memory snapshots. |
| `Learner Engine`        | Trains a personalized LLM using passive/self-supervised learning. |
| `Policy Adapter`        | Extracts intent or strategies from behavior. |
| `Action Predictor`      | Predicts next likely step in user’s task. |
| `Cognitive Agent`       | Acts on behalf of the user when authorized. |
| `Self-Evaluator`        | Uses reward signals or logs to reinforce useful patterns. |

## 🔐 Privacy & Control

* 🧠 All learning is local by default.
* 🔒 No outbound data collection or cloud upload.
* ✅ User approves agent actions before execution (configurable).

---

## 🔄 Future Extensions

* Multi-modal input (speech, biometrics).
* Multi-agent collaboration (team cognition).
* Cross-device behavior modeling.
* Cloud-assisted sync (optional with encryption).
