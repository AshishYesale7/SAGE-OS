## Recommendations

### Critical Issues
- Address all critical issues immediately
- Review privilege escalation risks
- Implement proper input validation

### High Priority
- Fix buffer overflow vulnerabilities
- Implement bounds checking
- Use safe string functions

### Medium Priority
- Review memory management
- Add proper error handling
- Implement security best practices

### Security Hardening
- Enable stack protection (-fstack-protector)
- Use ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization)
- Implement DEP (Data Execution Prevention)
- Add security-focused compiler flags

## Next Steps

1. Review and fix critical and high severity issues
2. Implement automated security testing
3. Add security-focused unit tests
4. Regular security audits
5. Consider using static analysis tools like:
   - Clang Static Analyzer
   - Cppcheck
   - PVS-Studio
   - Coverity
