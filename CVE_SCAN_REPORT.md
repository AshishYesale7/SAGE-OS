# CVE Vulnerability Scan Report - SAGE OS

## Scan Date
2025-05-27

## Summary
CVE vulnerability scanning attempted using cve-bin-tool v3.4. The scan requires downloading the CVE database which takes significant time and network resources.

## Scanned Binaries
- `build/x86_64/kernel.elf` - SAGE OS x86_64 kernel binary
- `build/x86_64/kernel.img` - SAGE OS x86_64 kernel image

## Scan Status
- **Status**: Database download required
- **Tool**: cve-bin-tool v3.4 (Intel CVE Binary Tool)
- **Database**: NVD CVE database download needed for offline operation

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Set up CVE database**: Run `cve-bin-tool --update` to download the latest CVE database
2. **Regular scanning**: Implement automated CVE scanning in CI/CD pipeline
3. **Dependency tracking**: Maintain SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) for all components

### Security Measures Implemented
1. **License headers**: All source files now include proper license headers
2. **Build isolation**: Kernel built with `-nostdlib -nostartfiles -ffreestanding` flags
3. **Memory safety**: Basic memory management implemented
4. **Input validation**: Shell commands include basic input validation

### Future Security Enhancements
1. **ASLR**: Implement Address Space Layout Randomization
2. **Stack protection**: Add stack canaries and protection
3. **Control Flow Integrity**: Implement CFI for function calls
4. **Secure boot**: Add secure boot verification
5. **Sandboxing**: Implement process isolation and sandboxing

## CVE Scanner Integration
The project now includes:
- `scripts/cve_scanner.py` - Comprehensive CVE scanning script
- Support for binary and Docker image scanning
- JSON output format for integration with CI/CD
- Automated vulnerability reporting

## Next Steps
1. Download CVE database: `cve-bin-tool --update`
2. Run full scan: `python3 scripts/cve_scanner.py`
3. Review and address any identified vulnerabilities
4. Integrate CVE scanning into GitHub Actions workflow

## Notes
- CVE scanning is essential for production deployments
- Regular updates to CVE database recommended (daily/weekly)
- Consider using mirrors for faster downloads in CI/CD environments
- Implement vulnerability management process for identified CVEs
