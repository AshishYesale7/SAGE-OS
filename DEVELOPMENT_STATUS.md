## Current Status by Architecture

### x86_64 Architecture ‚úÖ Mostly Working
- **Build Status**: ‚úÖ SUCCESS
- **Multiboot Header**: ‚úÖ FIXED - Properly positioned and loadable
- **GRUB Loading**: ‚úÖ SUCCESS - GRUB finds and loads kernel
- **ISO Generation**: ‚úÖ SUCCESS - Bootable ISO created
- **Kernel Execution**: ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL - Hangs after GRUB loads (needs long mode transition)

### ARM/AArch64 Architecture ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Testing
- **Build Status**: ‚ùì UNTESTED
- **Cross-compilation**: ‚úÖ Toolchain installed
- **Boot System**: ‚ùì NEEDS TESTING
- **Image Generation**: ‚ùì NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION

### RISC-V Architecture ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Testing
- **Build Status**: ‚ùì UNTESTED
- **Cross-compilation**: ‚úÖ Toolchain installed
- **Boot System**: ‚ùì NEEDS TESTING
- **Image Generation**: ‚ùì NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION

## Remaining Tasks

### High Priority üî¥
1. **Fix x86_64 Long Mode Transition**
   - Implement proper 32-bit to 64-bit mode transition
   - Add paging setup and GDT configuration
   - Test kernel execution after GRUB handoff

2. **Test Multi-Architecture Builds**
   - Validate ARM/AArch64 cross-compilation
   - Test RISC-V build process
   - Create architecture-specific configurations

3. **Complete CVE Security Scanning**
   - Download CVE database (requires time/bandwidth)
   - Run full vulnerability scan on all binaries
   - Address any identified security issues

### Medium Priority üü°
4. **Test GitHub Actions Workflows**
   - Validate CI/CD pipeline end-to-end
   - Test multi-architecture builds in GitHub Actions
   - Verify artifact generation and upload

5. **Image Testing & Validation**
   - Test ISO images on real hardware/VMs
   - Validate different image formats
   - Test emulation with QEMU

6. **Documentation Enhancement**
   - Add architecture-specific guides
   - Create troubleshooting documentation
   - Add performance benchmarks

### Low Priority üü¢
7. **Advanced Features**
   - AI subsystem integration testing
   - Quantum computing library validation
   - Advanced security feature implementation

## Technical Debt & Known Issues

### Boot System
- **x86_64 long mode transition incomplete** - Kernel hangs after GRUB loads
- **Architecture-specific boot code needed** for ARM/RISC-V
- **Memory management initialization** needs enhancement

### Build System
