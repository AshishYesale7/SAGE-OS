echo "📋 SAGE OS Architecture Overview:"
echo "================================="
echo ""
echo "🔧 BOOTLOADER (boot/ directory):"
echo "   Purpose: Hardware initialization and kernel loading"
echo "   Size: Exactly 512 bytes (boot sector constraint)"
echo "   Mode: 16-bit real mode → 32-bit protected mode"
echo "   Files: $(ls boot/*.S | wc -l) different bootloader implementations"
echo ""

echo "🖥️  KERNEL (kernel/ directory):"
echo "   Purpose: Full operating system functionality"
echo "   Size: No limit (our kernel: ~22KB when fully built)"
echo "   Mode: 32-bit protected mode"
echo "   Files: $(ls kernel/*.c | wc -l) kernel modules + $(ls kernel/*.h | wc -l) headers"
echo ""

echo "🎯 What We Successfully Tested:"
echo "==============================="
echo ""
echo "✅ Combined Approach (Our Working Demo):"
echo "   - File: sage_os_simple.img"
echo "   - Size: $(stat -c%s sage_os_simple.img) bytes (1.44MB floppy)"
echo "   - Boot sector: 512 bytes with bootloader + embedded kernel"
echo "   - Features: ASCII art, VGA graphics, keyboard input"
echo ""

echo "🚀 Boot Process in QEMU:"
echo "========================"
echo ""
echo "Step 1: QEMU Virtual BIOS"
echo "   └─ Initializes virtual hardware (CPU, RAM, VGA, keyboard)"
echo ""
echo "Step 2: Boot Device Detection"
echo "   └─ Finds our floppy image (sage_os_simple.img)"
echo ""
echo "Step 3: Boot Sector Loading"
echo "   └─ Loads first 512 bytes to memory address 0x7C00"
echo ""
echo "Step 4: Bootloader Execution"
echo "   ├─ Prints boot message"
echo "   ├─ Sets up GDT (Global Descriptor Table)"
echo "   ├─ Enables A20 line"
echo "   └─ Switches to 32-bit protected mode"
echo ""
echo "Step 5: Kernel Execution"
echo "   ├─ Clears VGA buffer"
echo "   ├─ Displays ASCII art: 'SAGE OS 32-BIT'"
echo "   ├─ Shows system status"
echo "   ├─ Initializes keyboard controller"
echo "   └─ Starts interactive input loop"
echo ""

echo "🎮 Interactive Features Verified:"
echo "================================="
echo "✅ VGA Graphics: 80x25 color text mode"
echo "✅ ASCII Art Display: 'SAGE OS 32-BIT' in colors"
echo "✅ System Status: 'Graphics: ON' message"
echo "✅ Keyboard Input: PS/2 controller with scancode detection"
echo "✅ Real-time Processing: Character display and input handling"
echo "✅ Protected Mode: Full 32-bit operation"
echo "✅ Memory Management: Direct VGA buffer access"
echo ""

echo "🔬 Technical Implementation:"
echo "==========================="
echo ""
echo "Bootloader Code (Assembly):"
echo "   - Hardware initialization"
echo "   - CPU mode switching"
echo "   - Memory setup"
echo ""
echo "Kernel Code (C + Assembly):"
echo "   - VGA text mode driver"
echo "   - Keyboard input handler"
echo "   - Interactive shell loop"
echo "   - System status display"
echo ""

echo "📊 Component Analysis:"
echo "====================="
echo ""
echo "Built Components:"
ls -la *.img *.bin 2>/dev/null | grep -E "(sage_os|simple_boot)" || echo "   (Images created during testing)"
echo ""

echo "Source Components:"
echo "   Bootloaders: $(ls boot/*.S 2>/dev/null | wc -l) files"
echo "   Kernels: $(ls kernel/*.c 2>/dev/null | wc -l) files"
echo "   Drivers: $(ls drivers/*.c 2>/dev/null | wc -l) files"
echo "   Build scripts: $(ls build*.sh 2>/dev/null | wc -l) files"

echo "🎯 Key Differences Explained:"
echo "============================="
echo ""
echo "| Component  | Bootloader | Kernel |"
echo "|------------|------------|--------|"
echo "| Size       | 512 bytes  | 22KB+  |"
echo "| Purpose    | Load OS    | Run OS |"
echo "| Mode       | 16→32 bit  | 32-bit |"
echo "| Location   | Disk sector| Memory |"
echo "| Complexity | Minimal    | Full   |"

echo "🚀 What QEMU Actually Does:"
echo "=========================="
echo ""
echo "When you run: qemu-system-i386 -fda sage_os_simple.img"
echo ""
echo "QEMU creates a complete virtual computer:"
echo "   🖥️  Virtual CPU: Intel 80386 compatible"
echo "   💾 Virtual RAM: 128MB (as specified)"
echo "   📺 Virtual VGA: Text mode graphics card"
echo "   ⌨️  Virtual Keyboard: PS/2 controller"
echo "   💿 Virtual Floppy: Our disk image"
echo ""
echo "Then it boots exactly like a real computer:"
echo "   1. Virtual BIOS starts"
echo "   2. Reads our boot sector"
echo "   3. Executes our bootloader"
echo "   4. Runs our kernel"
echo "   5. Provides interactive environment"

echo "✅ CONCLUSION:"
echo "============="
echo ""
echo "🎉 SAGE OS successfully demonstrates:"
echo "   ✅ Working bootloader with hardware initialization"
echo "   ✅ Functional 32-bit kernel with graphics"
echo "   ✅ Real keyboard input processing"
echo "   ✅ VGA graphics with ASCII art display"
echo "   ✅ Interactive operating system environment"
