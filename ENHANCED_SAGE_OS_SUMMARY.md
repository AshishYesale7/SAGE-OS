## 🎮 Usage Instructions

### Quick Start
```bash
# Build enhanced SAGE OS
./build-enhanced.sh build i386

# Test interactively
./build-enhanced.sh test i386 interactive

# Available commands in SAGE OS:
sage> help          # Show all commands
sage> version       # OS version info
sage> ls            # List files
sage> save test.txt Hello World  # Save file
sage> cat test.txt  # Display file content
sage> rm test.txt   # Delete file
sage> clear         # Clear screen
sage> exit          # Exit SAGE OS (or Ctrl+A then X)
```

### File Management Examples
```bash
sage> save welcome.txt Welcome to SAGE OS Enhanced!
sage> save readme.txt This is a test file with multiple lines
sage> ls            # Shows both files with details
sage> cat welcome.txt  # Displays file content
sage> rm welcome.txt   # Removes file
sage> pwd           # Shows current directory
```
