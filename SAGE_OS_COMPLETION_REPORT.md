2. SAGE OS ASCII art displays
3. Welcome message with attribution
4. Interactive shell starts
5. All commands work (help, ls, mkdir, touch, cat, nano, exit)
6. Graceful shutdown with "Thank you for using SAGE OS!"
7. System halts properly
```

### x86_64 Architecture: ✅ BUILDS SUCCESSFULLY
- Cross-compilation working
- Multiboot header properly generated
- ELF wrapper created successfully

### aarch64 Architecture: ✅ CROSS-COMPILATION WORKING

```

## 📋 Problem Resolution

### Issues Resolved:
1. **Terminal Lockups**: Solved with tmux session isolation
2. **Architecture Compatibility**: Implemented conditional assembly
3. **File Naming**: Proper versioning with date stamps
